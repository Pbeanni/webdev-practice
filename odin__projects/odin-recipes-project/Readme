I used this project to test several things, I didn't like the final result and I don't intend to finish it, but I believe it was very useful to put into practice many ideas and test their results, the site was completely made only with html and css, so there are many css hacks that I've tested exhaustingly, maybe I'll go back and try to implement those functionality the right way with Javascript
